JAVASCRIPT is synchronous as ek time pe ek code run hoga
single threaded means doesnt use multithread
(being sync and single thread is default behaviour of java script)


EXECUTION CONTEXT:
=>execute one line of code at a time
each operation waits for last one to complete before executing

BLOCKING CODE
=>block the flow of program
=>read file sync
NON-BLOCKING CODE
=>do not block code 
=>read file async

//in case of login we should use block code as registration successful messege before login verification

when we want to use ASYN approach 
we have Web api which reminds us work 

suppose our stack class settimeout which is in Web api
settimeout writes in register that we have perform this task after this much time 
=>we can apply on any event
we will have plenty of taste with specific time 
so we utilize task queue atteched to register call back 


example:
console.log('1')
timeout(0sec)
console.log('2')
console.log('3')
output: 1 3 2 
because timeout(0sec) pehpe call hoga phir execute hoga 2 tab tk 3 print ho jayega thats why it takes time

*few APIs are added in Web
fetch(): high priority is given to it.
